//! Prometheus metrics 統合。
//!
//! `metrics` crate を facade に使い、`metrics-exporter-prometheus` で `/metrics`
//! endpoint に Prometheus text 形式で露出する。
//!
//! ## 露出されるメトリクス
//!
//! - `s4_requests_total{op,codec,result}` (counter): PUT/GET 要求総数。
//!   `result` は `ok` / `err`、`op` は `put` / `get`、`codec` は dispatch 結果
//! - `s4_bytes_in_total{op,codec}` (counter): client から受け取った bytes 累計
//! - `s4_bytes_out_total{op,codec}` (counter): backend に送る (PUT) / client へ
//!   返す (GET) bytes 累計
//! - `s4_request_latency_seconds{op,codec}` (histogram): 1 request の所要時間。
//!   bucket は default (10ms-10s)
//!
//! 圧縮率は Prometheus 側で `s4_bytes_out_total / s4_bytes_in_total` で計算可能。
